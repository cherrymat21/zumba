            <b>Perfect For</b><br>
            Everybody and every body! Each Zumba® class is designed to bring people together to sweat it on.

        <p>
           <b>How It Works</b> <br>
            We take the "work" out of workout, by mixing low-intensity and high-intensity moves for an interval-style, calorie-burning dance fitness party. Once the Latin and World rhythms take over, you'll see why Zumba® Fitness classes are often called exercise in disguise. Super effective? Check. Super fun? Check and check.
        </p>
        <p>

            A total workout, combining all elements of fitness – cardio, muscle conditioning, balance and flexibility, boosted energy and a serious dose of awesome each time you leave class.
